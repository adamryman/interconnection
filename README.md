# Interconnection

I am going to use d3 to make a posted I have always wanted to make.

I am not very proud of this code at the moment, have not done javascript in a
while and I just hacked this together until it worked.

Though it is good to share, right?

This code implements a Poisson-disc sampling algorithm specified in this paper by [Robert Bridson.](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf)
